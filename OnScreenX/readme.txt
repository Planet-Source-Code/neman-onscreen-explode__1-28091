Philosophy: Every man is important as a part of mankind. 
                     Every man's life can have value between  -1 and 1.  
                     Average of values of all humans is direction of this World. 
                     So, take the responsibility.


	This application is an example of using DirectAnimation in VB. There is also example of idea how to put animation directly on top of other windows or desktop without window. In fact this is a trick, because it copy part of screen, do animation on that bitmap and then put it back on screen.
	There is a problem when you minimize window on which animation is currently running because Lost_focus event doesn't trigger. If someone has a solution I would be pleased to see it. I'm also interested how fast is this animation on some slower PC (I have Athlon 1200, 256 DDR).  So mail me on above address.
	Same animation can be embed in html by using VBScript or JScript. You can also put shadow that will be shown in background.
	 Earth.jpg must be in same dir as application.
